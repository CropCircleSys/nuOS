nuOS software is and will always be free. Free to use, free to modify, free to distribute. 

Beside the 7 root association bitcoin donation addresses, the deposits to which will fund the project as a whole, there are goal-specific addresses which are used to steer the direction of the project at the behest of contributors. If you have a suggestion for a plan or a recommendation for a sub-categorization please join the project forum and send a message.

If you develop enhancements to the software your contributions of patches or pull requests to the project's association are greatly appreciated, not mandatory. Your open planning and coordination with our developers and users on the project forum will help the project advance with greater success and unification, but is not an expectation.

Your contributions of time and quality code may earn you coin! Your contribution of coin will spur advancement and refinement. Vote with your coin for plans as specifically or generally as you prefer. Various contributing developers within and loyal to the nuOS project may be publicly traded or accepting private investment, so bitcoin donations are not the only way to contribute to or steer the project. Fund our loosely-knit worldwide band of merry nerds! Feed, clothe, bathe or shelter your local nerd and encourage them to advance the nuOS project!

These are the tenets of this project as outlined in the README:
