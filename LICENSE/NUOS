nuOS software is and will always be free: 1. to use, 2. to modify, 3. to distribute. Different portions may be covered under different licenses, clarifying how those last two rights may be combined, but that first right will always be total and absolute. Once released rights granted can never be revoked by anyone, not even the copyright holder.

Additionally, nuOS software 4. does and will always come with free support. You may get as little as you pay for, hopefully more, ideally all that you need. If anyone sold you support for a fee they have a conflict of interest influencing them to confuse you. If software is worth paying for then it shouldn't require any support. If it ever required any support then software is not worth paying for. nuOS is supported by friends, hackers, nerds and users not unlike yourself. Ourselves.

Your friendly nerd, hopefully easy to reach, ideally local, who recommended or delivered this software may have charged you an agreeable fee for such service and you may have even gone so far as to offer further gratuity. Key to understand is that such service should include alternative options and possibility of recommendation or delivery of any software, not just nuOS or products of Chad J. Milios and Crop Circle Systems, Inc. The merit of any software shall be based solely on its quality and applicability to your needs. Furthermore it is crucial to understand neither payment nor gratuity shall be requested nor offered for the right to use the software or for the support of its use. To do so is an insult to the user and a dishonor to the author and distributor. This distributor shall be your primary point of contact for all support. If this person shall escalate your support needs to their point of contact for nuOS or anyone else support shall always remain free.

Training in the use and mastery of software, hardware and computer technology may warrant an agreeable charge. Quality software should already be easy enough to use that the utilization of the entire gamut of its capability can be accomplished by any one individual possessing any two of the following: 1. ability and willingness from a free and open able mind to devote a modicum of focused attention, 2. stewardship of hardware sufficient to fulfill said software's modest, ideally meager, requirements or 3. the luxury to expend (beyond the comfort to spend) one peanut per day. Quality software should be fully capable of total and complete application of its function with minimal requirements as close as possible to the bare requirements necessary for any base function.

Mastery on the other hand may be revered worthy of a far greater investment, however under no circumstance shall it be expensive, excessively difficult or sold as some form of black art, voodoo, magic, club, access or privilege. The act of creation of custom modification or enhancements to software may warrant an agreeable charge. Anyone should be met with scrutiny and suspicion should they make attempt to license such product of modification under more restrictive terms or less affordable fees than the original work. Software becomes less valuable, not more, the moment its price, or the price for its support, is increased from free because the quality of software is directly correlated to its ability to reproduce, disseminate and evolve.

Uses as claimed in paragraph four shall include use operation management updating and modifying software. Support as claimed in paragraph two and training as asserted in paragraph four shall cover all uses. Modification as asserted in paragraph five shall always be unrestricted and includes both sanctioned customization and bootleg alteration. Support therein constitutes provision and support of totally unrestricted free access to all components necessary to completely and totally facilitate application of all uses. Such complete self-support may be beyond the scope of an average user but should never be out of reach for the software's three most impoverished users might they willingly cooperate to accomplish peaceful endeavor.

If a software update introduces sufficient functionality, its recommendation or delivery may again be worth a further agreeable charge or gratuity. Any such update shall include beside the software an included work of art, perhaps of arguable talent, with apparent certain significant effort, of an original endeavor created or licensed for nuOS. The effort embodied within the update to the software ought to be of similar or greater effort and quality than the included work of art, subject to your perception of the collective judgment of the software's users and their peers. Form may closely embrace function but should always follow it. It is much preferred that the two are easily uncoupled, though it is equally preferred the two are well integrated.

The copyright holder reserves the right to create derivative incarnations of the software with the derivations licensed under new terms. All others are permitted to create derivative works subject to the terms of this license and the specific software licenses covering the applicable portions. All portions of nuOS software are covered by this license and individual portions are further covered by one of the following three declarations of terms which should have also been distributed to you along with this software: the public domain disclaimer, the Simplified Berkley Software Distribution license or the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0.

For clarity it is stated here that software that runs atop the nuOS free software platform and/or beside components distributed by the nuOS project do not need to be covered by this license and may be licensed in any way deemed appropriate by their copyright holders.
