nuOS software is and will always be free. Free to use, free to modify, free to distribute. Different portions may be covered under different licenses, clarifying how those last two rights may be combined, but that first right cannot be revoked. For any given release of software, rights granted can never be revoked by anyone, not even the copyright holder.

nuOS software is and will always come with free support. You may get as little as you pay for, hopefully more, ideally all that you need. If anyone sold you support for a fee they have a conflict of interest influencing them to confuse you. If software is worth paying for then it shouldn't require any support. If it ever required any support then software is not worth paying for. nuOS is supported by friends, hackers, nerds and users not unlike yourself. Ourselves.

Your friendly nerd, hopefully easy to reach, ideally local, who recommended or delivered this software may have charged you an agreeable fee for such service and you may have even gone so far as to offer further gratuity. Key to understand is that such service should include alternative options and possibility of recommendation or delivery of any software, not just nuOS or products of Chad J. Milios and Crop Circle Systems, Inc. The merit of any software shall be based solely on its quality and applicability to your needs. Furthermore it is crucial to understand payment or gratuity should never be requested nor offerred for the software or support of its use. To do so is an insult to user and computer scientist. This person shall be your primary point of contact for all support. If this person shall escalate your support needs to their point of contact for nuOS or anyone else support must always remain free.

Training in the uses and mastery of software, hardware and computer technology may warrant an agreeable charge. Software should already be easy enough to use that the utilization of the entire gamut of its capability can be accomplished by one individual having any two of the following: attention from an open and free able mind, the luxury to expend (beyond the comfort to spend) one peanut per day or stewardship of hardware sufficient to fulfill said software's modest, ideally meager, requirements. Software should be fully capable of total and complete application of its function with minimal requirements as close as possible to the bare requirements necessary for any base function.

Mastery on the other hand may be revered worthy of a far greater investment, however under no circumstance shall it be expensive, excessively difficult or sold as some form of black art, voodoo, magic, club, access or right. Creation of custom modification or enhancements to software may warrant an agreeable charge. One should be met with scrutiny and suspicion should one attempt to license such product of modification under more restrictive terms or less affordable fees than the corresponding original work. Software becomes less valuable, not more, the moment its price, or the price for its support, is increased from free. Uses as claimed in paragraph four shall include use operation management updating and modifying software. Support as claimed in paragraph two and training as paragraph four asserts shall cover all uses. Modifying software shall include both sanctioned customization and bootleg alteration. Support therein constitutes provision and support of totally unrestricted free access to all components necessary to completely and totally facilitate application of all uses. Such self-support may be beyond the scope of an average user but should never be out of reach for the software's five most impoverished users might they willingly cooperate to accomplish peaceful endeavor.

If an update introduces sufficient functionality, its recommendation or delivery may again be worth a further agreeable fee. Any such update shall include, beside the software, a work of art, perhaps of arguable talent, certainly with apparent significant effort, of an original endeavor, created or licensed for nuOS. The effort embodied within the update to the software ought to be of similar or greater effort and quality than the included work of art, subject to your perception of the collective judgement of the software's users and their peers. Form may closely embrace function but should always follow it. It is much preferred that the two are easily decoupled, though it is equally preferred the two are well integrated.

The copyright holder reserves the right to create derivative incarnations of the software with [only] the derivations licensed under new terms. All others are permitted to create derivative works subject to the terms of the applicable software licenses.
